# wac

Hey everyone, I'm Grey from [Coder](https://coder.com). I'm one of the core engineers
on a project called "WAC" that builds Coder workspaces declaratively from YAML. This
repository contains a `.coder/coder.yaml` file that I'm using to test the flow.
A preview of the documentation is available over at [cdr/docs](https://github.com/cdr/docs/pull/163).

Happy Coding!
